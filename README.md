# Project Structure
## 1. Preprocessing
  - **Duplicate Data Removal**: We’ll start by identifying and removing any duplicate records from the dataset.
  - **Column Filtering**: Next, we’ll select relevant columns for analysis.
## 2. Visualization
  - **Matplotlib**: We’ll use Matplotlib to visualize relationships between different columns in our DataFrame.
  - **Grouping by Country**: We’ll group data by country, considering sales amount and the number of customers. Visualizing this grouping will provide valuable insights.
## 3. RFM Analysis
  - **Labeling Customers**: Using the RFM method, we’ll label customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value. This segmentation will help tailor marketing strategies.
  - **Suggested Actions**: We’ll provide actionable suggestions for each customer segment.
## 4. Retention Rate Analysis
  - **Heat Map**: In the final phase, we’ll create a heat map to analyze customer retention rates over time.
